# A small django/python/heroku app to add modifiers to icalendar feeds

This django/python/heroku app is a basic example to get ical from one address, modify
the events and render the output again. See
https://github.com/holli/icalendar_modifier/blob/master/modifiers/views.py#L56

I'm having all my Facebook events in my Google calendar. Works fine except some
people make events like "winter practices" that clutter calendar view. So now I route
some of my calendar imports through this app to change multiday events to singleday.
